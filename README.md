# Born out of Frustration, Built for Empowerment! 

DEVSA is a community-driven initiative with a clear vision to collaborate and elevate the San Antonio tech space. We believe in the immense potential of our city's tech scene and are committed to fostering a thriving ecosystem for developers

While San Antonio celebrates its growing reputation as a cybersecurity hub and strengthens ties with Monterrey and the South Texas triangle, we refuse to let the headlines overshadow the needs of San Antonio's developer community. 

## Together, we'll write the next chapter of San Antonio's tech story
