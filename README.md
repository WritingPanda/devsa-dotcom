## Pull Request Welcome

We have activated GitHub Discussions and implemented a structured template for reporting issues and bugs. This enhancement empowers every member of our community to contribute by reporting anomalies or proposing innovative features.

## Let's collaborate!

-   [ ] **Create a new issue** to discuss your ideas and get feedback from the community. Issue templates are available in the repository.
-   [ ] **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your contributions.
-   [ ] **Make your changes** and submit a pull request.

## Some Ideas for Contributions

-   [ ] **Add a login/logout feature with authentication**
-   [ ] **Create an option to receive payments** from the website. Give sponsors the option to donate to the community anonymously or publicly.
-   [ ] **Create an events calendar** create option to add/edit/delete events to a calendar.
-   [ ] **Create a developer showcase route** on the website to display developers from the community with links to their portfolios and social media profiles.
-   [ ] **Create a jobs board** for the website to display job postings from the community.
-   [ ] **Add feature: add/edit/delete jobs from the job board** on the website.

-   [ ] **Create a blog** for the website. Should we connect to a headless tool like `hashnode` or keep it simple with `markdown` files?
-   [ ] **Add option to add/edit/delete blog posts** on the website.
-   [ ] **Create a commerce store** for the website. What data should we collect? How should we process payments? Should we use a headless tool like `Hydrogen`?
