## San Antonio's Booming Tech Scene: A Missed Opportunity?

San Antonio's tech sector is buzzing with excitement. The thriving cybersecurity space, a 5 Billion dollar industry, is a major force, and the recent 3 year deal the city signed to attract talent from the South Texas triangle holds immense promise. But amidst this growth, a crucial segment of the tech ecosystem seems overlooked: our developers ðŸ¤—

**The Unsung Heroes:**
Layoffs have impacted developers, leaving many feeling uncertain and unsupported. Bootcamp graduates, enthusiastic but underprepared, often struggle to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. This lack of focus on developer needs hinders the tech sector's true potential.

**Beyond the Headlines:**
The flashy headlines about cybersecurity and startups rarely delve deeper. The real power behind this growth lies in the tools, languages, and frameworks developers wield to build the technology driving progress.

**Call for Action:**
San Antonio's tech scene has the potential to be truly inclusive. Let's champion the developers who form the backbone of innovation. We need to provide them with resources, training, and support to thrive in this ever-evolving landscape.
